## Introduction

The Cold Storage Monitoring System is designed to assist cold storage facility owners in monitoring and controlling the temperature and humidity levels within their storage rooms. By utilizing IoT devices, cloud integration, and automated alerts, the system enables real-time monitoring, remote accessibility, and data visualization.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity levels in cold storage rooms.
- Remote access to real-time data through a web-based dashboard or mobile application.
- Automated email notifications when temperature or humidity thresholds are breached.
- Historical data visualization through graphs and charts.
- Energy optimization techniques for reduced power consumption.
- Scalable architecture to accommodate multiple storage rooms.

## System Architecture

The Cold Storage Monitoring System consists of the following components:

- Temperature and humidity sensors placed strategically within the storage room.
- Microcontroller or IoT device to collect and process sensor data.
- Wireless communication protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi) for data transmission.
- Cloud platform (e.g., Thingspeak) for storing and analyzing sensor data.
- Web-based dashboard or mobile application for remote access and visualization.
- Automated alert mechanism to notify owners via email.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cold-storage-monitoring-system.git

2. Install the required dependencies [provide any specific dependencies or libraries used].

3. Configure the microcontroller or IoT device to interface with the temperature and humidity sensors.

4. Set up the cloud platform (e.g., Thingspeak) for data storage and analysis. Create an account and obtain the necessary API keys.

5. Customize the web-based dashboard or mobile application to suit your specific requirements [provide instructions or reference separate customization documentation].

6. Update the configuration file with your API keys, thresholds, and other relevant settings.

## Usage

1. Connect the temperature and humidity sensors to the microcontroller or IoT device.

2. Power on the system and ensure that the microcontroller is connected to the internet.

3. Access the web-based dashboard or mobile application to monitor real-time temperature and humidity readings.

4. Configure the desired temperature and humidity thresholds for automated alerts.

5. Monitor the system and receive email notifications when thresholds are breached.
